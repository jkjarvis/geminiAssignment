# Jobcoin Mixer

The Jobcoin Mixer is a simple implementation of a mixer for the virtual currency Jobcoin. It allows users to obfuscate their transaction flow and maintain privacy on the Jobcoin network.

## Introduction
The Jobcoin Mixer is designed to provide privacy for Jobcoin transactions by mixing the coins from multiple users before distributing them to the desired output addresses. It follows a similar concept to Bitcoin mixers.

## Usage
To use the Jobcoin Mixer, follow these steps:
1. Create an instance of the `Mixer` class.
2. Add users to the mixer using the `addUser` method, providing their wallet address and output addresses.
3. When a user wants to send Jobcoins to the mixer, call the `transaction` method, providing the sender's wallet address and the number of coins.
4. The mixer will transfer the coins to a pool address and increment the pool coins count.
5. The `transactToOutputAddresses` method can be called to distribute the mixed coins to the specified output addresses of each user.

## Code Structure
The code consists of the following main components:
- `Mixer`: The main class representing the Jobcoin Mixer. It manages the mixer users, pool, transactions, and handles the mixing process.
- `Transaction`: A class representing a transaction with sender's wallet address, number of coins, and a flag indicating if the coins have been forwarded.
- `MixerPool`: A class representing the mixer pool with total coins and an address.
- `MixerUser`: A class representing a user of the mixer with their original address, output addresses, and output address allocation.

## Next Steps
The current implementation provides a basic functionality for the Jobcoin Mixer. However, there are several considerations for further improvement:
- Implement the actual mechanisms for coin selection, shuffling, and output transaction generation.
- Add error handling and validation for various scenarios, such as missing addresses, insufficient funds, or incorrect allocations.
- Improve the efficiency and security of the mixer, considering privacy vulnerabilities and potential mitigation strategies.
- Enhance the user interface or API for interacting with the mixer.
- Consider implementing additional features like transaction fees, mixing strategies, or advanced privacy techniques.
